abstract = {Anomaly detection is indispensable in modern IT infrastructure management. However, the dimension explosion problem of the monitoring data (large-scale machines, many key performance indicators, and frequent monitoring queries) causes a scalability issue to the existing algorithms. We propose a coarse-to-fine model transfer based framework CTF to achieve a scalable and accurate data-center-scale anomaly detection. CTF pre-trains a coarse-grained model, uses the model to extract and compress per-machine features to a distribution, clusters machines according to the distribution, and conducts model transfer to fine-tune per-cluster models for high accuracy. The framework takes advantage of clustering on the per-machine latent representation distribution, reusing the pre-trained model, and partial-layer model fine-tuning to boost the whole training efficiency. We also justify design choices such as the clustering algorithm and distance algorithm to achieve the best accuracy. We prototype CTF and experiment on production data to show its scalability and accuracy. We also release a labeling tool for multivariate time series and a labeled dataset to the research community.},

abstract = {As more and more sensor data have been collected, automated detection, and diagnosis systems are urgently needed to lessen the increasing monitoring burden and reduce the risk of system faults. A plethora of researches have been done on anomaly detection, event detection, anomaly diagnosis respectively. However, none of current approaches can explore all these respects in one unified framework. In this work, a Multi-Task Learning based Encoder-Decoder (MTLED) which can simultaneously detect anomalies, diagnose anomalies, and detect events is proposed. In MTLED, feature matrix is introduced so that features are extracted for each time point and point-wise anomaly detection can be realized in an end-to-end way. Anomaly diagnosis and event detection share the same feature matrix with anomaly detection in the multi-task learning framework and also provide important information for system monitoring. To train such a comprehensive detection and diagnosis system, a large-scale multivariate time series dataset which contains anomalies of multiple types is generated with simulation tools. Extensive experiments on the synthetic dataset verify the effectiveness of MTLED and its multi-task learning framework, and the evaluation on a real-world dataset demonstrates that MTLED can be used in other application scenarios through transfer learning.},

abstract = {The anomaly detection of time series is a hotspot of time series data mining. The own characteristics of different anomaly detectors determine the abnormal data that they are good at. There is no detector can be optimizing in all types of anomalies. Moreover, it still has difficulties in industrial production due to problems such as a single detector can't be optimized at different time windows of the same time series. This paper proposes an adaptive model based on time series characteristics and selecting appropriate detector and run-time parameters for anomaly detection, which is called ATSDLN(Adaptive Time Series Detector Learning Network). We take the time series as the input of the model, and learn the time series representation through FCN. In order to realize the adaptive selection of detectors and run-time parameters according to the input time series, the outputs of FCN are the inputs of two sub-networks: the detector selection network and the run-time parameters selection network. In addition, the way that the variable layer width design of the parameter selection sub-network and the introduction of transfer learning make the model be with more expandability. Through experiments, it is found that ATSDLN can select appropriate anomaly detector and run-time parameters, and have strong expandability, which can quickly transfer. We investigate the performance of ATSDLN in public data sets, our methods outperform other methods in most cases with higher effect and better adaptation. We also show experimental results on public data sets to demonstrate how model structure and transfer learning affect the effectiveness.},

Previously confined in a walled garden, SS7 has become more exposed due to increased liberalization of the market in conjunction with the industry switching to IP technology. In the walled garden of trusted operators, security have received minimal attention. SS7 has become more vulnerable in the recent years, with attackers exploiting network communications to track subscribers, intercept calls, perform denial of services, and commit fraud. This master thesis is a part of the effort to reduce the vulnerabilities contained in the old, yet crucial protocols that the telecommunication operators cannot function without. Subscribers, operators, and national governments are dependent on one of societies critical infrastructures, it needs to be adequately protected. In this thesis, a detailed overview of SS7 threats and vulnerabilities is presented. In an effort to mitigate these attacks, open source technology has been used to simulate network traffic. This generated traffic were used to analyse and detect attacks against SS7 in an effort to propose detection mechanisms. Machine learning, big data, and anomaly detection techniques have been used as tools in order to propose an improved online protection system for SS7 networks.

abstract = {Large network logs, recording multivariate time series generated from heterogeneous devices and sensors in a network, can often reveal important information about abnormal activities, such as network intrusions and device malfunctions. Existing machine learning methods for anomaly detection on multivariate time series typically assume that 1) normal sequences would have consistent behavior for training unsupervised models, or 2) require a large set of labeled normal and abnormal sequences for supervised models. However, in practice, normal network activities can demonstrate significantly varying sequence patterns (e.g., before and after rerouting partial network traffic). Also, the recorded abnormal events can be sparse. This paper presents a novel semi-supervised method that efficiently captures dependencies between network time series and across time points to generate meaningful representations of network activities for predicting abnormal events. The method can use the limited labeled data to explicitly learn separable embedding space for normal and abnormal samples and effectively leverage unlabeled data to handle training data scarcity. The experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperformed state-of-the-art approaches for event detection on a large real-world network log.},

abstract = {Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) are critical for providing good user experience of cloud services. CDN providers typically collect various multivariate Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) time series to monitor and diagnose system performance. State-of-the-art anomaly detection methods mostly use deep learning to extract the normal patterns of data, due to its superior performance. However, KPI data usually exhibit non-additive Gaussian noise, which makes it difficult for deep learning models to learn the normal patterns, resulting in degraded performance in anomaly detection. In this paper, we propose a robust and noise-resilient anomaly detection mechanism using multivariate KPIs. Our key insight is that different KPIs are constrained by certain time-invariant characteristics of the underlying system, and that explicitly modelling such invariance may help resist noise in the data. We thus propose a novel anomaly detection method called SDFVAE, short for Static and Dynamic Factorized VAE, that learns the representations of KPIs by explicitly factorizing the latent variables into dynamic and static parts. Extensive experiments using real-world data show that SDFVAE achieves a F1-score ranging from 0.92 to 0.99 on both regular and noisy dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.},

To evaluate our metrics, we explore several real-world mobile call networks. We find that people tend to communicate with the one who has similar structure.

In this paper, we introduce the Compressed Sensing technique to multivariate time series anomaly detection for rapid initialization. To build a jump-starting anomaly detector, we propose an approach named JumpStarter. Based on domainspecific insights, we design a shape-based clustering algorithm as well as an outlier-resistant sampling algorithm for JumpStarter. With real-world multivariate time series datasets collected from two Internet companies, our results show that JumpStarter achieves an average F1 score of 94.12%, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms, with a much shorter initialization time of twenty minutes.

Identifying the anomalous points can be a goal on its own (anomaly detection), or a means to improving performance of other time series tasks (e.g. forecasting). Recent deep-learning-based approaches to anomaly detection and forecasting commonly assume that the proportion of anomalies in the training data is small enough to ignore, and treat the unlabeled data as coming from the nominal data distribution. We present a simple yet effective technique for augmenting existing time series models so that they explicitly account for anomalies in the training data. By augmenting the training data with a latent anomaly indicator variable whose distribution is inferred while training the underlying model using Monte Carlo EM, our method simultaneously infers anomalous points while improving model performance on nominal data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by combining it with a simple feed-forward forecasting model. We investigate how anomalies in the train set affect the training of forecasting models, which are commonly used for time series anomaly detection, and show that our method improves the training of the model.},

Recent approaches have achieved significant progress in this topic, but there is remaining limitations. One major limitation is that they do not capture the relationships between different time-series explicitly, resulting in inevitable false alarms. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised framework for multivariate time-series anomaly detection to address this issue. Our framework considers each univariate time-series as an individual feature and includes two graph attention layers in parallel to learn the complex dependencies of multivariate time-series in both temporal and feature dimensions. In addition, our approach jointly optimizes a forecasting-based model and a reconstruction-based model, obtaining better time-series representations through a combination of single-timestamp prediction and reconstruction of the entire time-series. We demonstrate the efficacy of our model through extensive experiments. The proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art models on three real-world datasets. Further analysis shows that our method has good interpretability and is useful for anomaly diagnosis.},

abstract = {To ensure the safety and stability of spacecrafts of which thousands of telemetry parameters are monitored, fast and accurate response to anomalies or potential hazards is very important and challenging. This task becomes more difficult when the obtained telemetry data are sampled at irregular intervals. Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM), as time series prediction models, have been applied to satellite anomaly detection and show a promising prospect. However, the anomaly detection method merely based on LSTM does not show a stable performance: when the prediction performance of LSTM is not satisfying, the performance of subsequent anomaly detection will be affected, and the impact is augmented when the telemetry data are of irregular intervals. In order to solve these problems, time intervals are introduced into the LSTM model directly. Besides that, a novel anomaly detection method, Detecting Anomalies using LSTM and Ensembled One-Class Support Vector Machines (DALEO) is proposed to further improve the performance of anomaly detection. In DALEO, multiple One-Class Support Vector Machines are used to obtain the ensemble outputs of high precision and high recall respectively. These ensemble outputs are integrated into the two stages of the anomaly detection method with LSTM in a novel way. Extensive empirical studies on real-world datasets of satellites and space shuttles demonstrate that DALEO improves the performance of anomaly detection significantly when dealing with telemetry data with irregular intervals.},

Detecting outlier machine instances with multivariate time series is crucial for service management. However, it is a challenging task due to the multiple classes and various shapes, high dimensionality, and lack of labels of multivariate time series. In this article, we propose DOMI, a novel unsupervised model that combines Gaussian mixture VAE with 1D-CNN, to detect outlier machine instances. Its core idea is to capture the normal patterns of machine instances by learning their latent representations that consider the shape characteristics, reconstruct input data by the learned representations, and apply reconstruction probabilities to determine outliers. Moreover, DOMI interprets the detected outlier instance based on the reconstruction probability changes of univariate time series. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the dataset collected from 1821 machines with a 1.5-month-period, which are deployed in ByteDance, a top global content service provider. DOMI achieves the best F1-Score of 0.94 and AUC score of 0.99, significantly outperforming the best performing baseline method by 0.08 and 0.03, respectively. Moreover, its interpretation accuracy is up to 0.93.},

In this paper, we present WETAS, a novel framework that effectively identifies anomalous temporal segments (i.e., consecutive time points) in an input instance. WETAS learns discriminative features from the instance-level labels so that it infers the sequential order of normal and anomalous segments within each instance, which can be used as a rough segmentation mask. Based on the dynamic time warping (DTW) alignment between the input instance and its segmentation mask, WETAS obtains the result of temporal segmentation, and simultaneously, it further enhances itself by using the mask as additional supervision. Our experiments show that WETAS considerably outperforms other baselines in terms of the localization of temporal anomalies, and also it provides more informative results than point-level detection methods.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is a crucial task for monitoring various status (i.e., metrics) of entities (e.g., manufacturing systems and Internet services), which are often characterized by multivariate time series (MTS). In practice, it's important to precisely detect the anomalies, as well as to interpret the detected anomalies through localizing a group of most anomalous metrics, to further assist the failure troubleshooting. In this paper, we propose InterFusion, an unsupervised method that simultaneously models the inter-metric and temporal dependency for MTS. Its core idea is to model the normal patterns inside MTS data through hierarchical Variational AutoEncoder with two stochastic latent variables, each of which learns low-dimensional inter-metric or temporal embeddings. Furthermore, we propose an MCMC-based method to obtain reasonable embeddings and reconstructions at anomalous parts for MTS anomaly interpretation. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets from different industrial domains (three existing and one newly published dataset collected through our pilot deployment of InterFusion). InterFusion achieves an average anomaly detection F1-Score higher than 0.94 and anomaly interpretation performance of 0.87, significantly outperforming recent state-of-the-art MTS anomaly detection methods.},

abstract = {The automatic supervision of IT systems is a current challenge at Orange. Given the size and complexity reached by its IT operations, the number of sensors needed to obtain measurements over time, used to infer normal and abnormal behaviors, has increased dramatically making traditional expert-based supervision methods slow or prone to errors. In this paper, we propose a fast and stable method called UnSupervised Anomaly Detection for multivariate time series (USAD) based on adversely trained autoencoders. Its autoencoder architecture makes it capable of learning in an unsupervised way. The use of adversarial training and its architecture allows it to isolate anomalies while providing fast training. We study the properties of our methods through experiments on five public datasets, thus demonstrating its robustness, training speed and high anomaly detection performance. Through a feasibility study using Orange's proprietary data we have been able to validate Orange's requirements on scalability, stability, robustness, training speed and high performance.},

abstract = {Recent advances in AIoT technologies have led to an increasing popularity of utilizing machine learning algorithms to detect operational failures for cyber-physical systems (CPS). In its basic form, an anomaly detection module monitors the sensor measurements and actuator states from the physical plant, and detects anomalies in these measurements to identify abnormal operation status. Nevertheless, building effective anomaly detection models for CPS is rather challenging as the model has to accurately detect anomalies in presence of highly complicated system dynamics and unknown amount of sensor noise. In this work, we propose a novel time series anomaly detection method called Neural System Identification and Bayesian Filtering (NSIBF) in which a specially crafted neural network architecture is posed for system identification, i.e., capturing the dynamics of CPS in a dynamical state-space model; then a Bayesian filtering algorithm is naturally applied on top of the "identified" state-space model for robust anomaly detection by tracking the uncertainty of the hidden state of the system recursively over time. We provide qualitative as well as quantitative experiments with the proposed method on a synthetic and three real-world CPS datasets, showing that NSIBF compares favorably to the state-of-the-art methods with considerable improvements on anomaly detection in CPS.},

abstract = {In real-world maintenance applications, deep generative models have shown promising performance in detecting anomalous events of entities from time-series signals collected from multiple sensors. Nevertheless, we outline two important challenges of leveraging such models for times-series anomaly detection: 1) developing effective and efficient reconstruction models and 2) exploiting the similarity and interrelation structures among the multivariate time series data channels. To address these challenges, in this paper we propose a stacking variational auto-encoder (VAE) model with graph neural networks for the effective and interpretable time-series anomaly detection. Specifically, we propose a stacking block-wise reconstruction framework with a weight-sharing scheme for the multivariate time series data with similarities among channels. Moreover, with a graph learning module, our model learns a sparse adjacency matrix to explicitly capture the stable interrelation structure information among multiple time series data channels for interpretable reconstruction of series patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed model outperforms the strong baselines on three public datasets with considerable improvements and meanwhile still maintains the training efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the intuitive stable structure learned by our model significantly improves the interpretability of our detection results.},

abstract = {As more and more sensor data have been recorded, automated anomaly detection of high reliability is urgently needed to lessen the increasing monitoring burden and reduce the risk of system faults. To this end, this paper proposes a method named Anomaly Detection Assisted by Discrimination Model (ADADM). In ADADM, the anomaly score for each point in sequences is calculated using an LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder model. In the mean time, a discrimination model based on ALSTM-FCN distinguishes the subsequences containing the Known Type Anomalies (KTAs) from others. Finally, we set two different thresholds for above two types of subsequences respectively and determine the anomalous points according to the anomaly scores and the corresponding threshold. Experiments on four real datasets of periodicity/aperiodicity and univariable/multivariable demonstrate that not only ADADM can improve the overall performance significantly, but also can improve the precision and recall of the anomaly detection simultaneously.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection in time series is one of exciting topics in data mining. The aim is to find a data point which is different from the majority, called an anomaly. In this paper, a novel anomaly score called Median-Difference Window subseries Score (MDWS) is proposed with its algorithm and the recommended window size for detecting the contextual anomalies on time series data. It is computed as the subtraction of the middle point with the median of all data points within the current window. The proposed MDWS algorithm is implemented as the median-update of the current window subseries to maintain the linear time complexity. Two anomaly thresholds are set as the mean plus/minus three standard deviation for extracting the anomalies. Furthermore, the suitable window size for detecting anomalies is investigated and suggests that it should be smaller than the seasonal period. The experimental results show that the MDWS has the highest accuracy performance on the benchmark datasets from Yahoo comparing with others existing anomaly detection methods.},

However, the reconstruction errors, generated in such manners, contain external noises of the system, making reconstruction errors as anomaly scores less effective. In this brief, we present an additional hypothesis that autoencoders may introduce additional statistical noise in the reconstruction errors as well. Our proposal includes a design of an autoencoder, lays out a theoretical basis of designing a noise filter for reconstruction errors, and outlines various aggregation methods to reduce the effect of the noise. While further work is still needed, we are able to show the accuracy improvement by using various aggregation methods.},
